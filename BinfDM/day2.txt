Data Mining:
Clustering
Predictive Modeling
Association Rules
Anomaly Detection

Labeled Data is used to create training data with a Learn Classifier (Modeling)
Labels are usually the end result you want to predict or measure

Supervised:
Classification
Regression
Unsupervised:
Clustering (because we only use attributes)

To calculate the variance you use this formula:


One take home message from Statistics:
Statistics is all about variati
Variance is king, mean is a little soldier.

Types of Attributes:
Nominal - Distinctness - ID numbers, zip codes
Ordinal - Distinctness & Order -Rankings from a scale, grades, height {short, medium, tall}
Interval - Distinctness & Order & Meaningful Differences - Calendar dates
Ratio Attribute - All 4 properties/operations - temp in Kelvin



Countably Infinite: {1, 2, 3, â€¦.}
Uncountable Infinet: All the values between 0 & 1
Discrete Variables are finite or countably infinite
Continuous Attributes use real numbers
