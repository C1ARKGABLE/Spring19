Mainframe => HPC => Cloud computing
All similar, but improved price points.

Mainframe, no processing at client level, just text consoles
HPC, light preprocessing and prep on client side
Cloud computing, rent a HPC. Can spin up/spin down storage, GPU/CPU cores, memory as needed.


Big data has large variety (complexity)

Relational Database
Text data
Semi-structured (XML)
Graphs
Streaming

Some big data is public. NASA pushes tons of data for public analysis.


Data is generated quickly, must be processed quickly.
Late decisions -> missed opportunities (Aka targeted advertising)
