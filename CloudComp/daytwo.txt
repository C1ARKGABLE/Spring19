Mainframe => HPC => Cloud computing
All similar, but improved price points.

Mainframe, no processing at client level, just text consoles
HPC, light preprocessing and prep on client side
Cloud computing, rent a HPC. Can spin up/spin down storage, GPU/CPU cores, memory as needed.


Big data has large variety (complexity)

Relational Database
Text data
Semi-structured (XML)
Graphs
Streaming

Some big data is public. NASA pushes tons of data for public analysis.

Data is generated quickly, must be processed quickly.
Late decisions -> missed opportunities (Aka targeted advertising)

Large companies store large quantities, with hopes that data will become valuable

Old model: Few companies are generating data, other consume from the few

Cloud computing
IT resources provided as a service
Offerings from Microsoft, Amazon, Google

Benefits:
Cost and management, outsourced
Reduced time to deploy, work outta the box
Scaling, on demand... Scale up or down
Reliability, redundant, shared
Sustainability, hardware need not be upgraded


Types
  Public cloud:
    Hosted on vendor's premise
  Private cloud:
    Dedicated within organization
  Hybrid cloud:
    Hosts private information on private cloud, noncritical on public

IaaS:
Infrastructure as a Service, AWS, etc
