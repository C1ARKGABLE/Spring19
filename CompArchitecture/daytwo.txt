Subtraction is addition with negative numbers.
Can't indicate a negative number in the traditional way (eg -28)

In binary, we use twos complement
  a binary number, N, can be represented as 2**n - N, where n is the number of bits

  (2) 0010's twos complement would be 10000 (16) - 0010 (2) = 1110


  Magic algorithm:
    Flip digits and add one
    (7) 0111 -> 1000 + 1 -> (-7) 1001
