Four pillars
  Narrative (A picture that tells a story)
  Phenomenology (What is happening in the picture)
  Ethnography (f(x,y) = r(x,y) * i(x,y), what do you build, what's the background, metadata)
  Grounded Theory (Fourier Transform)

Fourier Transform is to connects time domain to frequency
  x(t) ---> Frequency

The sequence is Fourier Series
  Fourier Transform
Periodic or Aperiodic

Laplace transform

Fourier will only transform stable signals (limitation and interruptions change outcomes)
  Continuity is broken when signals aren't stable

Digital image points can be infinite, we can study sample points rather than the entirety

Our eyes can see an image, can see minute shadows in an xray or MRI.

Our eyes only have a certain bandwidth to see with

A picture captures the image as the sensor sees it (EM waves)

Phenomenology in terms of amplitude and magnitude
Magnitude of waves are between 0 and 1
